## 🧩 BQ Game App – MVP (Backend)
* Client: Bicycle Queensland (Brisbane, Australia)
* Project Type: Industry Project – Android MVP
* Team Size: 4 members (2 backend developers, 1 frontend developers, 1 project manager)
* My Role: Backend Developer
* Tech Stack: Node.js · Express · Firebase Admin SDK · Firestore · Firebase Cloud Functions

## 📖 Overview
This project was developed in collaboration with Bicycle Queensland to create a gamified mobile app that encourages children to complete outdoor challenges (walk, ride, or scoot).

## 👩‍💻 My Contributions (Backend Focus)
As one of two backend developers, I contributed to both backend API implementation and overall Firestore data structure design for the project.

## Key contributions:
- **Data Structure Design**
  - Participated in planning the overall Firestore schema covering `users`, `feedback`, `auth_logs`, `challengeSessions`, and `locations`.
  - Ensured consistency and scalability of data models used across backend modules.
- **API Development**
  - Implemented APIs for `user`, `feedback`, and `location tracking` using Express.js.
  - Integrated Firebase Admin SDK for Firestore operations and token verification.
- **Cloud Function Development**
  - Built a scheduled Firebase Cloud Function for monthly location analytics.
- **Team Collaboration**
  - Worked with the second backend developer on schema design and data integration.
  - Collaborated with frontend members via Postman testing and Git-based version control.


## 🤝 Team Collaboration
* Followed an Agile workflow, conducting weekly Zoom meetings with the client to review progress and gather feedback.
* Used Git for version control and branch-based collaboration across backend and frontend teams.
* Worked closely with teammates via pair programming and code review sessions.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
* Strengthened backend development skills in Node.js and Express.
* Practiced Firestore CRUD operations using Firebase Admin SDK.
* Implemented secure ID token verification for user authentication.
* Built a scheduled Firebase Cloud Function for automated data aggregation.
* Enhanced team collaboration through Git version control, Postman testing, and regular Zoom client reviews.
